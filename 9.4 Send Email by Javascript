How to send an email from JavaScript ?

In this article, we will learn how to send mail using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol which is a free JavaScript library. 
It is basically used to send emails, so it only works for outgoing emails. To be able to send emails, you need to provide 
the correct SMTP server when you set up your email client. Most internet systems use SMTP as a method to transfer 
mail from one user to another. It is a push protocol. In order to use SMTP, you need to configure your Gmail. 
You need to change two settings of your Gmail account from which you are sending the mail i.e.

    Revoke 2-step verification
    Enabling less secure apps to access Gmail. You can easily do this by clicking on the link Enable

After this just create an HTML file and include SMTP in your <script></script> tag : 

<script src="https://smtpjs.com/v3/smtp.js"></script>

Below is the HTML file which you will need to run in order to send the mail. 

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Send Mail</title>

<script src="https://smtpjs.com/v3/smtp.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
	function sendEmail() {
	Email.send({
		Host: "smtp.gmail.com",
		Username: "sender@email_address.com",
		Password: "Enter your password",
		To: 'receiver@email_address.com',
		From: "sender@email_address.com",
		Subject: "Sending Email using javascript",
		Body: "Well that was easy!!",
	})
		.then(function (message) {
		alert("mail sent successfully")
		});
	}
</script>
</head>

<body>
<form method="post">
	<input type="button" value="Send Email"
		onclick="sendEmail()" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
