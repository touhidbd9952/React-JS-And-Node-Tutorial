What is redux and How it works?
1. redux has a central store
2. every component can access it
3. component can not change redux store data by it self
4. when any component need to change redux store data, it send action to "Reducer function"
5. in action, is define what type of change need to do
6. only Reducer function can update Redux Store
7. Reducer funtion takes two parameter (action, currentState)
8. Reducer send "Updated State" to Redux Store
9. when Reducer send "Updated State" to Redux Store, a function "Subscription" is automatically call
8. after update Redux Store, Subscription function  pass Updated State as Props to the component
