What is redux and How it works?
1. redux has a central store
2. every component can access it
3. component can not change redux store data by it self
4. when any component need to change redux store data, it send action to "Reducer function"
5. in action, is define what type of change need to do
6. only Reducer function can update Redux Store
7. Reducer funtion takes two parameter (action, currentState)
8. Reducer send "Updated State" to Redux Store
9. when Reducer send "Updated State" to Redux Store, a function "Subscription" is automatically call
8. after update Redux Store, Subscription function  pass Updated State as Props to the component

Step-1: to use redux in react project we need to install redux

	install redux --save
        install react-redux --save

Step-2: create a folder "redux" in "src"

Step-3: create a file "reducer.js" in "redux" folder

	in reducer.js
	-----------------
	import DISES from '../data/dishes';  //db table
	import COMMENTS from '../data/comments'; //db table
	
	const initialState = {      
	   dishes: DISES,
	   comments: COMMENTS,
	}

	const Reducer = (state=initialState, action) => {
	    return state;
	}
	
	export Reducer;

Step-4: create a file "store.js" in "redux" folder

	in store.js
	--------------------
	import { createStore } from 'redux';
	import { Reducer } from './reducer.js';

	const myStore = createStore(Reducer);

	export default myStore;

Step-5: now we need to access database from component, so in "App.js" import redux store and import Provider from react-redux

	import myStore from './redux/store.js';
	import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

	function App() {
	 //console.log("App.js:", myStore.getState());  //to check data passing or not
	  <Provider store={myStore}>   //store is a builtin keyword
	    <BrowserRouter>
  	      <MainComponent />
	    </BrowserRouter>
	  </Provider>
	}
	export default App;

Step-6: to access global data (redux store) in component we need to "connect" react-redux to component

	in "Menu.js" component
	---------------------------------
	import { connect } from 'react-redux';

         //get necessary table from redux
	const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
	   return {
	      dishes : state.dishes,
	      comments: state.comments
	   }
	}

	class Menu extends  Component {
	   state = {
	     selectedDish: null,
	     modelOpen: false,
	   }

	   render() {
	       return (
	          <div>
		<Menuitem
	    		dishes = {this.props.dishes}
	     		comments = {this.props.comments}
	 	/>
	          </div>
	       );
	  }
	}
	export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Menu);	//connect component with redux
